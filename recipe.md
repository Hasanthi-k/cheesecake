=>RECIPE
=>1. Preheat the oven to 180C and put a baking sheet on the middle shelf. Crush the biscuits by putting them into a freezer bag and hitting them with a rolling pin – you want to leave some larger chunks in there, so this is better than using a food processor, although you can pulse them in there instead if you prefer. Melt the butter in a small pan, then add the crumbs and a pinch of salt and mix well.

=>2. Spread the crumbs over the base of a tall 20cm cake tin (springform if you have one) and press down firmly with a glass until you have a well compacted, flat base. Put the tin into the hot oven for 20 minutes while you make the topping.

=>3. Put the cheese into a large bowl and stir with a whisk to soften it and get rid of any lumps. Mix in the soured cream, cornflour, sugar, lemon zest and vanilla extract. Beat the whole eggs together, and then add them to the mixture, little by little, then beat just until the mixture is smooth.

=>4. Take the tin out of the oven and brush the surface of the base lightly with egg white. Turn the oven down to 110C and keep the door open for a couple of minutes to help it to cool down.

=>5. Leave the base for a few minutes while the oven cools, then pour the mixture into the tin, and shake gently to level it. You can run your finger gently over the top to get rid of any air bubbles. Put on the hot baking sheet and bake for about 1½ hours, until set, but still slightly wobbly in the middle. Run a thin spatula around the edge to separate the cake from the tin, then turn the oven off and allow the cheesecake to cool completely inside before taking it out, removing from the tin and refrigerating.
